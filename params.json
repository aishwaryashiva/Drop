For example, if you have multiple files in multiple folders and you want those files to be attached to an email or uploaded to a server then normally you will select those files by going to each and every folder or copy them to one location and then upload them. But copying can be a difficult task when the files are large.\r\n\r\nDrop allows you to drag those files in Drop Bucket and then drag them together on your email or where you want to upload/use them.\r\n\r\nDrop also monitors your Windows Clipboard for data and adds it to Drop Bucket automatically.\r\n\r\nA demostration of how it works can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT_jAjn0wA0\r\n\r\nDownload from here: http://drop.codeplex.com/\r\n\r\n![Download Drop](https://d2yca1enuxtdrs.cloudfront.net/images/resize/product/1240/9631314306fedf04f6dff87b821b857e.jpg)",
