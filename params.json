For example, if you have multiple files in multiple folders and you want those files to be attached to an email or uploaded to a server then normally you will select those files by going to each and every folder or copy them to one location and then upload them. But copying can be a difficult task when the files are large.\r\n\r\nDrop allows you to drag those files in Drop Bucket and then drag them together on your email or where you want to upload/use them.\r\n\r\nDownload from here: http://drop.codeplex.com/\r\n",
