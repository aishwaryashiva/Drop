# Drop
This is official repository for Drop Lite.

Drop Lite is a simple application that uses drag and drop method to transfer multiple data between multiple applications. For example, if you have multiple files in multiple folders and you want those files to be attached to an email or uploaded to a server then normally you will select those files by going to each and every folder or copy them to one location and then upload them. But copying can be a difficult task when the files are large.

Drop allows you to drag those files in Drop Bucket and then drag them together on your email or where you want to upload/use them.
